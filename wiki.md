## Reading materials


## Think piece
### CyberGIS framework
*Wang (2010)* proposed the CyberGIS framework for synthesizing geographic information systems (GIS), spatial analysis, and cyberinfrastructure (CI). The urge of such a framework originates from the incompatibility between solving computationally intensive and collaborative problems and the single central processing unit (CPU) and single user interface in many fields. 
### Week 2's think piece
*Wang (2010)* proposed the CyberGIS framework for synthesizing geographic information systems (GIS), spatial analysis, and cyberinfrastructure (CI). The urge of such a framework originates from the incompatibility between solving computationally intensive and collaborative problems and the single central processing unit (CPU) and single user interface in many fields. Under this circumstance, the author presented GISolve Toolkit that incorporates high-performance and distributed spatial analysis, data and visualization, and collaboration support. The GISolve workflow demonstrates its potential in handling large-scale spatial analysis through a case study analyzing the impact of climate change on US crop yields. From a transportation engineering perspective, I personally resonate with the author’s argument about the limitations of single CPU and single user interface when transportation mobility data are generally enormous and cover a wide geographic area. We seek a high-performance workflow paradigm, quite similar to the ones mentioned in Wang’s paper, that can remove the computational barrier. 

The other reading material *Zhao and Huang(2020)* introduced the encrypted monument in memory of Dr. Li. The transformation of a physical and tangible memorial space to a virtual crypto space is evidence of Feenberg’s statement that technological objects have both social meaning dimension and cultural horizon. Using encrypted technology in this way is “a surplus of workable solutions” where the social factor and user shape technology usage. I would also like to touch on how urban planners view the relationship between the built environment and society. People have a set of social norms and practices, which they adhere to while interacting with the physical environment. Generally speaking, the physical environment can be divided into realized and exploited potential, recognized but unexploited potential, and possible unexploited potential. The boundaries are dynamic when the interaction takes place under a different context. For example, many streets and pedestrian walking zone are solely used for transit purposes. But given the social distancing rule during COVID-19, these open spaces are converted to outdoor dining areas for restaurants to utilize. Converting outdoor space into dining areas is either recognized but unexploited potential or possible unexploited potentials to many of us before COVID-19. Zhao and Huang’s article strikes me deeply to think how researchers can apply this way of thinking to virtual spaces.
