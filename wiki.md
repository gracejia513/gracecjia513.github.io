## Reading materials


## Think piece
One or several paragraphs.
### CyberGIS framework
*Wang (2010)* proposed the CyberGIS framework for synthesizing geographic information systems (GIS), spatial analysis, and cyberinfrastructure (CI). The urge of such a framework originates from the incompatibility between solving computationally intensive and collaborative problems and the single central processing unit (CPU) and single user interface in many fields. 
### (Optional) Subsection 2
One or several paragraphs.
